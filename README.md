This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The site is a collection of the projects I built for the freeCodeCamp front end libraries certificate. Each projects was built with React - then all of the projects were combined using create-react-app/React Router (with code splitting) and the site was deployed with a Node/express backend. I also threw in a to-do list for good measure :).
